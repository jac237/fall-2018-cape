# FA18 CAPE Project

## Background

At the end of each quarter, UCSD asks students to fill out the Course and Professor Evaluations (CAPE) and the data is publicly posted online to show what percentage of students, for each section of a class, have filled out the survery. For example, for the class AIP 197T and section A00 with instructor "Wienhausen, Gabriele", 2 out of the 8 enrolled students (25%) filled out the CAPE survey. The [CAPE](https://cape.ucsd.edu/) survey is useful because it gives instructor feedback on what they are doing well and what areas they can improve on. Here is the [current response rate](http://www.cape.ucsd.edu/responses/current.aspx) for UCSD.

> **A Brief History of CAPE**  
*A Message from the Founder*   
CAPE was born in 1972 as one of several projects initiated by the Students' Educational Change Center. Founding members of the Center included Ian Boase, Jeff Unsicker, Michele Peltier, and Mickey Richardson, and it was as a student cooperative seeking to serve as a catalyst for broad educational renewal at UCSD.
>
> The notion that students could have a say in their own education was still a pretty radical and contested concept in 1972, and when CAPE was launched with classroom questionnaires in Fall quarter 1972 classrooms there was considerable faculty opposition. As the methodology improved and students began to take it seriously, CAPE's impact became more accepted within the institution. The publication also provided a forum for other educational change outreach efforts, such as the 12-page "Counter Catalog" insert in the Summer 1975 issue. The Counter Catalog included articles on UC history, the role of the university-industrial complex, the status of women at UCSD, and ongoing student struggles.

## Description

In this project, I explore the [datascience](http://data8.org/datascience/index.html) package and the [datascience.tables](http://data8.org/datascience/tables.html) class.  The documentation provides an easy-to-read and -follow introduction to the `datascience` package alongwith a tutorial on how to create Tables, manipulate Tables, and much more. 

> The datascience package was written for use in Berkeleyâ€™s DS 8 course and contains useful functionality for investigating and graphically displaying data.
